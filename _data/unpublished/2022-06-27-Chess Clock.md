## Project idea

Chess Clock is my first side project that saw a daylight. I started building it for three main reasons: 
- First of all I play chess from time to time and my friend and I needed a clock ðŸ˜€.
- I wanted to explore Jetpack Compose.
- I was thinking about deploying my own app to the store for the long time and I finally did it. I can recommend it to everyone, having an app that can serve you as a playground is a great opportunity to explore new technologies.

## Current state

Chess Clock is an OSS app that can replace classic clocks while playing over the board chess. App is free and has no ads.

---

## Where to find it

You can find the code [on my github](https://github.com/Leedwon/ChessClock) and you can download the app from [the play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledwon.jakub.chessclock)
